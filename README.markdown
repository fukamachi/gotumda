# Gotumda - All your action to do next

Gotumda is a web application to manage your tasks.

Though this application is tested on Clozure CL v1.6, this might work on other Lisp such as SBCL.

As this application's frontend is using Google Closure Library, Python is needed to start the server.

## Usage

Gotumda is written in Common Lisp.

    (ql:quickload :gotumda)
    (gotumda:start)
